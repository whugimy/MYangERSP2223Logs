### Unicorn Research Paper Notes:
#### Abstract:
Existing ML solutions for networking problems are not being implemented; this is because these ML artifacts are often unreliable. The paper makes the claim that these ML artifacts have poor quality due to their training data: the process of collecting data for ML is described as "one-off," "fragmented," and with two key issues: it is too difficult to compile data from different sources to use as training material for the same problem, and simultaneously too difficult to apply data from a single source to mutliple problems. The paper proposes a solution called "Unicorn," which sreamlines the process of collecting data from one source for multiple problems.

#### Introduction:
Network operators have, at any point, only a partial understanding of the state of their network, and they constantly need to make decisions to solve some arbitrary "problems." There seems to be industry interest in applying ML techniques to better make these decisions, but existing ML solutions are not being applied. This is because the industry feels wary of ML's innate "black-box" nature. The "black-box" issue refers to our lack of understanding regarding neural networks. Although we can use them, we have almost no insight into how they actually make decisions. The ML artifacts created with given data are simply too complicated for a human to understand. Industry members must then rely solely on the algorithm's results to determine its feasibility. In order for the algorithm to be "trustworthy," it must be able to adapt to and properly process information outside of its training set. Existing ML solutions struggle to do so, as they are often trained with data from one, specific source, and often do not correctly generalize to external data.

Everything beyond the background on the problem being solved describes Unicorn's specifications and how it would help solve the above problems. However, I don't have any technical understanding of ML models or data collection pipelines as they are described in the paper.

#### Experimental Process:
The paper describes the process of implementing a Unicorn prototype. The paper describes Unicorn's implementation being split into a frontend and backend. The frontend serves as an interface for the user to select and configure data-collection pipelines. An operation titled "execute" will connect these pipelines to Unicorn's backend and begin processing. Unicorn's backend consists of the following components: 
1. Connectivity-manager: connects Unicorn's front and backend
2. Compiler: translates data-collection pipeline's general data into specific forms depending on what problem the artifact will be trained for, then processes the data (not sure how)
3. Runtime: serves as sort of a general OS that handles queries and displays runtime info
4. Datastore: provides memory for the runtime to manage
