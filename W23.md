# MYangERSP2223Logs
My logs for ERSP 2022-2023

# Week 6
- identifying good use cases for further MLP training
- Roman suggested to use gradient boosting and random forest in addition to MLP
- looking at primary university of new brunswick training data
- busy week with midterms and a few class projects, will get back to work in following week

# Week 5
- missed logs for week 4, but in general progress was building MLP network for NSS Mirai dataset, unfortunately the dataset doesn't contain any benign data, only different classifications of attacks, which is not good
- Tuesday (2/7/2023) scrum, discussed random forest and gradient boost as alternative to deep learning techniques for training process, new datasets from stratosphere research and university of new brunswick to be used for future.
- This week I trained an MLP to predict class labels on an NSS Mirai Dataset. Model "works," but many labels are so few in sample size (like 35/ >= 50000) that it's kind of impossible to get good accuracy. Going to try again on a separate dataset.

# Week 3
- had a meeting on 1/29 to discuss frontend implementations
- Goal for this week (by either Friday or Sunday) is to have a python method (not necessarily one built on top of trustee but that would be ideal) that can output an html file that we can modify within the method. 
- If Sunday 3pm continues being a good time we should make it our regular time for check-in meetings
