My logs for ERSP 2022-2023

# Week 5
- missed logs for week 4, but in general progress was building MLP network for NSS Mirai dataset, unfortunately the dataset doesn't contain any benign data, only different classifications of attacks, which is not good
- Tuesday (2/7/2023) scrum, discussed random forest and gradient boost as alternative to deep learning techniques for training process, new datasets from stratosphere research and university of new brunswick to be used for future.

# Week 3
- had a meeting on 1/29 to discuss frontend implementations
- Goal for this week (by either Friday or Sunday) is to have a python method (not necessarily one built on top of trustee but that would be ideal) that can output an html file that we can modify within the method. 
- If Sunday 3pm continues being a good time we should make it our regular time for check-in meetings
