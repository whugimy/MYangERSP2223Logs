# Week 3
- had a meeting on 1/29 to discuss frontend implementations
- Goal for this week (by either Friday or Sunday) is to have a python method (not necessarily one built on top of trustee but that would be ideal) that can output an html file that we can modify within the method. 
- If Sunday 3pm continues being a good time we should make it our regular time for check-in meetings
